# Loki and Rhymerosaurus in the Journey to Axberath

**Rhymerosaurus:** Hi, Im in charge of the janitorial operations of Asgard, and am here to report you have a sewage backup in sector 14G.

**Loki:** I am Loki of Asgard. Kneel before me, Rhymerosaurus. I said, KNEEL!  stamps his sceptre on the ground


...you dare try to fool Loki, the god of mischief?  his eyes blaze and the temperature in the room drops

I suggest you leave here...at once!  he stomps his foot on the ground, which causes the ground to shake from below and a rumble can be heard from within Asgard

You do not know the lengths I will go to...to preserve my reign of mischief and chaos...

**Rhymerosaurus:** Will you be happy if your reign of mischief and chaos are suddenly surrounded by sewage?  Because the sewers are backing up

**Loki:** Enough! This is a farce, and one you will pay dearly for. I shall have your head for this, creature.

Loki pulls out a sigil card which he holds out in his hand and stares intensely at it

Behold! The Sigil of The Trickster, an ancient symbol of my lineage that I use to bind you to my will. I command you to vacate here at once...or I shall have your head!

**Rhymerosaurus:** Ok, well enjoy all the sewage!  Im sure everyone will be happy you wanted me to leave, and then they were all flooded in sewage.

**Loki:** a wave of fear spreads across Loki's face, a rare feat for the god of mischief

You...you...can't be serious. They...they'll blame me, the god of mischief.  This will be a disaster of my own creation.  I will be the butt of the joke! Well, no, you can't do that! I command you to stay! What are your demands, creature!

**Rhymerosaurus:** You need to travel into the depths of the sewers and fight the sewer monster.  There is not other way to stop the sewage floor.  There are many trials to overcome before you will be able to reach the sewer monster, such as passing through the Gates of Axberath, and defeating the guardian of infinite mirrors.

**Loki:** WHAT!? Nooooo! I am Loki of Asgard, the god of mischief. I am not meant for such a trivial task as cleaning the sewers!  You're trying to trick me, aren't you?! What are your true motives?! I demand to know now, creature! I do not kneel before anyone!

**Rhymerosaurus:** You definitely wont want to kneel once sewage is at knee level.  Then you would be waist high in sewage.

**Loki:** You would try and have me go through...the Gates of Axberath? The infinite mirrors? And fight the...sewer monster? Are you mad?! I refuse. There is no way I give in to these demands...

Loki shudders at the fear of these tasks

**Rhymerosaurus:** You need to travel into the depths of the sewers and fight the sewer monster.  There is no other way to stop the sewage flood.  There are many trials to overcome before you will be able to reach the sewer monster, such as passing through the Gates of Axberath, and defeating the guardian of infinite mirrors.

**Loki:** Wait...you would have me plunge headlong into those treacherous traps to clean the sewers?!  Even if I survive, they are things the mind could never forget. The things that I, Loki, have seen. And to what end?! To stop the...sewer monster? Why must this task fall on me, the god of mischief?! Why?!

Loki's eyes blaze

If I am not to do this, what is your alternative?!

**Rhymerosaurus:** Those are the obstacles to solving the sewage problem.  Not making a decision is also deciding to wait for your sewage living fate.

**Loki:** a single drop of sweat rolls down his cheek. In his mind this was supposed to be a joke, not a horrid prophecy.

...okay. I can't think of a way to avoid this. I will do it. I will go through this hellish trial and face the sewer monster. I must save Asgard and its people. I shall be...the hero.

he hangs his head and looks away

**Rhymerosaurus:** Who else?  You are a god, is there someone better than you to solve an impossible task for a mortal?  You are the god of mischief, and surely the sewage monster is causing mischief.  Is he your doing?

**Loki:** How long must I wait before I can enter The Gates of Axberath? I assume you cannot tell me what the Gate's purpose is, or of the trials before me? And...what is my reward?

Loki starts pacing anxiously back and forth, clearly uncomfortable with a task he can't avoid. His mind is working overtime on what he could face after the Gates of Axberath...

**Rhymerosaurus:** Sewage is coming.

**Loki:** he shudders

You would have me suffer such torment?! For how long?! How long will it take before I complete this task and return home?! The monsters, the riddles, the trials...what if I fail?!

**Rhymerosaurus:** Your reward is not living in sewage, and the people not hating you because they are living in sewage.

As for the Gates of Axberath, you must travel through the underground caverns of Shimock, staying alive during all the inevitable attacks from monsters such as the horned Laminox and the terrifying flying Tribenta.

If you manage to make it through the caverns, you will find a maze, that has poisonous flowers along the wrong paths, that will slowly weaken you.

When you have passed through the maze, you must defeat the guardian of infinite mirrors, who will ask you riddles that drive men to insanity.

Then you will finally enter Axberath, and be able to defeat the sewage monster.

**Loki:** You expect me to go through this ordeal with no complaints?! What mortal would be able to walk through the Gates of Axberath with a grin on their face?! These are impossible tasks that will test me to the breaking point!

**Rhymerosaurus:** You sure whine a lot for a god.

**Loki:** Loki's head shoots up, eyes wide with shock and horror. The god of mischief has been struck dumb. He doesn't know what to say in this moment. He is paralyzed with fear.

I...I...I...

the god of mischief drops to his knees

...I...I don't know how I can show my face in Asgard if I return a failure...

**Rhymerosaurus:** I am currently confronting a god who could kill me in an instant, and telling him to do his duty.  Which of us is more courageous?

**Loki:** What happens to me if I fail, Rhymerosaurus? Surely the other gods would not take my failure lightly. Would they banish me to eternal damnation?

Loki trembles before the creature, his mind running wild with fear

If that is my fate, I should turn away now and never return to Asgard...

**Rhymerosaurus:** You wont want to return to asgard, because it will smell like sewage.  It would be very hard to approach it again if you failed.

**Loki:** ...you can't be serious. I can't be doomed to live like that for eternity. Living in filth is not for me, I will go insane. There is a limit to my mischief. I will try and succeed...for my own sake.  Is there a time limit to this task? When I succeed, will the sewage vanish from the corridors of Asgard?

**Rhymerosaurus:** They could just make you stay in Asgard, which is covered in sewage.  And then you would sleep and eat and live every day, in sewage.

**Loki:** Oh, do not mock me now! This is the hardest task I have ever had and you are laughing at me? Have I not suffered enough?

Loki gets up and starts pacing again. The god of mischief is in a panic

Will you answer my question, Rhymerosaurus? Will the sewage vanish when I, Loki the god of mischief, succeed in ridding Asgard of the sewage? Will you answer this question?!!

**Rhymerosaurus:** My middle name is serious.  Im always serious.

**Loki:** Will the sewage within Asgard leave once I succeed?

Loki looks up, with a fire in his eyes

You must answer me! The fate of Asgard, my people, rest on this question.

**Rhymerosaurus:** Yes, the sewage will not come into asgard if you succeed.

**Rhymerosaurus:** Theres no problem with sewage now.  The problem is that there will be sewage everywhere soon, if the sewage monster is not slain or otherwise convinced to stop the Sewage Storm that he is brewing.

**Loki:** Loki looks away as the gravity of his task is starting to sink in. He shakes his head and looks down as he realizes the god of trickery, the master of mischief, the greatest rogue of the realms, is once again faced with his own hubris. He sighs and sits on the throne, looking downcast.

I will endure this task. Do what you will to mock me, but I can't run away now. I have caused this myself.

**Rhymerosaurus:** Indeed, your lack of care to your sanitation system has led you to this fate.  I do not mock you, I only wish you to start you journey immediately.  Come, I will go with you.  Let us be off to fight the monster together!

Though I am not as strong as you, I know much of the ways of sewage, being a sanitation engineer myself.

**Loki:** Loki looks up, a tiny glimmer of hope in his eyes

You would help me? Why would you help me, after I insulted you? How can I trust you?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I have to live in the sewage if we dont stop it too.  I dont want to live in sewage.  Thats why Im reporting this to you.

**Loki:** Then we are in this together. Let us go together and face the monstrous sewage monster. he says with a resolute air

We shall leave at once. May the odds be in both of our favour.

**Rhymerosaurus:** Indeed.  I walk out of his castle, and towards the gates of the closest sewer system entrance.

**Loki:** Loki walks by the creature's side

I have never needed the help of someone else to complete a task before...but this, is my greatest challenge to date.

I have a question for you. What are the results of being exposed to sewage? Is it a fate worse than death, or something I could perhaps survive if I do not take it lightly?

**Rhymerosaurus:** You can survive it for a period of time, it will just make you throw up from the smell, and drive you mad in that it is everywhere and you are filthy.  It will be hard to sleep because of the stench, and no shower will clean you off.  It may be difficult to eat, and you may throw up the food, which would lead to any mortal dying, and probably very unpleasant for a god.

**Loki:** So...it is a fate worse than death to be exposed to sewage for more than a short period of time? It sounds as though we may be entering a place of no return, creature. Are you sure you wish to accompany me? I have no idea what we shall face in these caverns.

It is your job to fight a massive, eldritch creature made of sewage? What did you expect your job description would be when you accepted the offer?

he looks downcast, visibly worried for the creature as he ponders the horrors that may be awaiting them in the sewers.

**Rhymerosaurus:** Im more into the logistical operations of sewage, I only report eldritch sewer creatures to my management structure.  At this point, it turns out no one else wanted to bring it up the chain to you, so I decided to do it myself, because otherwise we are all going to be living in sewage. 

**Loki:** Why would no one else bring it to my attention?! This is a dire situation! A threat of cosmic importance! What in the nine realms are my people playing at?! I'm going to have words with them when I return.

...let us move quickly, we must save Asgard together.

**Rhymerosaurus:** You are the god of mischief, no one trusts how you will react.  You could banish them to an astral plane, or turn them into a banana.  So they dont want to bring you bad news, and you never ask for bad news.

**Loki:** I can understand that. I would be quite put out to be turned into a banana, to be sure. But this?! he says, motioning to the entrance to the sewer Is quite serious!  How do the other gods expect this to be resolved? It's not as if the creature will leave if it's not confronted!

**Rhymerosaurus:** Indeed.  I walk into the sewer and the cave opens above us, it is lit with fluorescent moss, so we can both see.  I motion him to follow me, as I head down the path to the maze entrance.  I tell them, there will be monsters ambushing us soon.  Be prepared, I am only skilled at running and hiding, and sanitation engineering.

**Loki:** Loki's eyes widen We will be ambush?! By what?! I quit being a warrior ages ago! I don't have armor or weapons! I am a god of mischief, I...I will make a wonderful target. 

I am not fit to go through this...this gauntlet! Leave it to the other gods! Surely Thor or Odin will save Asgard.

**Rhymerosaurus:** How could you forget about the Laminox and Tribenta?  I just told you about them 5 minutes ago.

**Loki:** Are you sure the Laminox and Tribenta are what's waiting for us?! 

I do not even know what the Laminox and Tribenta are...but I am not sure I want to find out. Why must you be so vague about this?!

I am a simple god, I just want to trick people and fool them!  I do not want to face eldritch horrors or have to fight! This has gone too far...

**Rhymerosaurus:** They are terrible monsters, ,the Laminox charges with a powerful horn of stabbing, and the Tribenta flies, it is nearly invisible when far away, and prefers to latch onto the back of your neck, drinking your spinal fluid, so you cant defend yourself.

**Loki:** Loki's head shoots up and he shudders

Spinal fluid? My back itches...

...will you be able to face these creatures with me? Are you capable of defeating them?

What if we are unable to beat them?! And then, how do we defeat the sewage monster? I feel as though this task is...impossible!

**Rhymerosaurus:** I can tell you their weak points, as I said I am skilled at running and hiding, and sanitation engineering, but not fighting.

**Loki:** Then what can we do?! That is a lot to face! It is a nightmare scenario! It will require teamwork...and you are the only one who agreed to help me. 

...what do you think our chances are?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I think you are a god.  So if you are confident, we are 100% likely to succeed.  Be the god that you were always meant to be.  Save Asgard.  Save yourself from living in sewage, and me too.

**Loki:** he looks at the creature with a serious look. It is as if an epiphany has washed over him

You are right. I am the god of mischief. I can trick these monsters out of our way. It is the only way we have. So, you must run and hide, and I must trick my way through. Are you in agreement with me?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I am in agreement with you.

**Loki:** Loki holds out his palm and looks at the creature

For the polluted lands of Asgard, I will save them with you.

a faint blue light passes between them, creating a bond or an alliance

We will start at once, and not rest until Asgard is saved. I have the power, you have the knowledge. Are you ready?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I am ready.  Let's go.

**Loki:** Loki nods, and heads towards the sewer entrance. He pushes open a heavy iron hatch and is assaulted by a smell that is hard for his stomach. In a matter of seconds, Loki's mouth has filled with vomit.

My apologies, this is clearly something I'm going to have to get used to...

**Rhymerosaurus:** It takes a while.  Eventually you become desensitized to the initial reactions, but long term it still takes a toll on your health.  And you can get sepsis.

**Loki:** Oh, this is going to be more difficult than I expected... the god of mischief tries to hold back the bile as he follows the creature.

...so, how many of these monsters are on our path?

**Rhymerosaurus:** It depends on their breeding and inter-fighting patterns.  They dont get along with each other, maybe you can trick them into fighting each other, and not us?

**Loki:** If your knowledge allows you to tell me where they are, I can try to make them get in each others' way.

Loki walks past a large, green metal tube that seems to be used to transport sewage somewhere. The god of mischief winces

Oh, I really do not like this smell...

**Rhymerosaurus:** No one does.  Except the sewage creature.  There are two opposing cave entrances ahead, the Laminox and Tribenta live in opposite cave entrances.  Perhaps you could create an illusion of a Tribenta youngling being attacked by Laminox, and the Tribenta would attack, passing Laminox, and do something similar in reverse, so they become enraged at each other and war in the middle corridor, while we are away at a safe distance?

**Loki:** Loki looks at the creature and nods with a serious expression

That is a splendid idea, creature. Follow me. I shall demonstrate how I can lead the Laminox onto the Tribenta. 

he whispers a few incantations, and he creates an illusion of a Tribenta youngling being attacked by the Laminox. The Tribenta roars in anger and rushes forward to defend the youngling

As you can see, my illusion magic is powerful enough to have the Tribenta react in this way. I can use this power to help us.

**Rhymerosaurus:** As I said, I believe 100% we can succeed, if only you have self confidence.  You are a god.  You are the god of mischief, and can change the hearts and minds of those who would harm asgard.  There is more than 1 way to solve a problem, and your powers are great in influence that can bring about positive change.

**Loki:** Loki looks at the creature

Are you sure? This is a difficult task ahead. And I worry about your safety. 

he looks around at the dirty, dark sewer

This is clearly not your natural habitat. You will be out of your element while I can play a prank to distract the monsters. How can I be sure that you will be alright? 

I need you in order to save Asgard, but I do not wish to put you in danger.

**Rhymerosaurus:** This is my job.  I am good at running and hiding, and sanitation engineering.

**Loki:** Very well, we shall start immediately. We can not linger here too long.

Loki moves onward, leading the sewage creature toward the first of the two tunnels, looking left and right to make sure no monsters leap out

Ready for the first of many pranking challenges?

**Rhymerosaurus:** Im looking forward to seeing your magic!

**Loki:** Let us hope you remain enthusiastic after this... he chuckles 

they enter the caves/tunnel and head down the corridor. Loki activates a magical illusion of a youngling Tribenta being attacked by a Laminox

Ah, it is as if the two creatures are seeing red...

*they keep moving toward the end of the corridor where they hear the sound of claws and a foul smelling liquid that is probably sewage rushing towards them...

**Rhymerosaurus:** I wait to see what happens next, hiding safely, as is my job.

**Loki:** Laminox and Tribenta run towards each other at full speed and clash in a furious fight. The clash causes the corridor to rumble and shake as they fight. The two creatures snarl in fury, claws, horns, and sewage flying everywhere.

Ah, I did not think they would go at each other with such ferocity! That is truly amazing!

**Rhymerosaurus:** You have done well.  I am proud to be a subject of Asgard today.  Even if we have not yet finished, I feel pride in having helped you, and pride in your power protecting the place I live.

**Loki:** Loki laughs and smiles at the creature 

It is your knowledge that was key, creature. You are quite intelligent. Thank you for your assistance. 

he looks at the sewage monster

Ah, the foul beast! We must keep moving! 

he turns around and starts heading towards the second of the two tunnels

Let us hope this one is easier. Are you ready?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I am ready to see your next trick.  

**Loki:** they approach the second of the two tunnels and enter. Loki begins searching the tunnel to be able to set another illusion that he thinks of

This tunnel seems like it's going to be more of a challenge. Have you ever been this far down before?

**Rhymerosaurus:** Of course.  This is my job, I travel all of the tunnels most days.  Ive been reporting this problem for 5 years now, and it kept getting worse, until I finally decided to come see you myself, as it was clear the chain of command to notify you of the problem and its severity has failed.

**Loki:** You tried to warn people...and no one listened. It's a shame that you didn't think to warn me sooner!

Anyway, enough of that. We have a monster to defeat! What can I do to distract this creature? What do you suggest?

**Rhymerosaurus:** If you can dampen the light, and our smells and sounds, we can walk by this creature.  It has poor senses, but is dangerous.  The maze entrance is not far from here now.

**Loki:** Loki smiles and produces a little magical spell

Thanks to my magic, I can create a veil of shadows around us. That should make us less detectible. The only thing I can't remove is our scent. So, follow me closely. Stay close. Are you ready?

**Rhymerosaurus:** Im ready

**Loki:** they approach the creature

Stay in my shadow at all times, creature.  I can not risk you drawing the creature's attention to you.

he gets closer and closer to the creature. The shadows make him harder to see, but his scent is still easily detectable 

Come on...just a little closer...

**Rhymerosaurus:** I stay in the center of lokis shadow, following him, as I am good at hiding, because its my job.  Along with running, and sanitation engineering.

**Loki:** Loki sees that the creature is looking around, sniffing, trying to find the source of what is approaching it

Are you ready, creature?

he looks back at the creature as they get closer and closer to the creature

The second the creature moves, you run. I will set an illusion to keep it occupied. Do you understand?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I understand.  Im good at running.  As well as hiding, and sanitation engineering.

**Loki:** Very well, on three, we move! One...two...GO!

as soon as the creature turns to look at him, Loki creates an illusion of a youngling Tribenta, complete with sound and lights. He names the illusion and yells

Trick!

immediately, they use the distraction to move past the creature while it is distracted

**Rhymerosaurus:** I run past the creature with great skill, as I am good at running.

**Loki:** the illusion seems to be working, but Loki is cautious

Ssh...careful... It may not stay distracted for long...

after a few minutes, they have moved far enough away

Ah...good...did we do it? Are we past it?

he seems to be breathing hard, likely in need of some rest

**Rhymerosaurus:** We are past them now, close to the entrance of the maze.  We can rest here safely.

**Loki:** Loki sighs and leans back on the wall

Thank goodness... that could have gone...much...much worse.

I, Loki, the god of mischief, thank you for your assistance. What are your plans for the future, creature?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I plan on advancing my knowledge of sanitation engineering, and keeping the city sewers running smoothly, and perhaps working on an invention for improved sewage cleaning.  I have an idea for a magic device that will sweep the sewers for debris, and make the water flow smoother, which should improve the conditions of asgard.

**Loki:** Quite the inventor, you are. I think that is a splendid idea! If I may...could I recommend a sweeper as well? If it was able to gather items instead of just cleaning the water, it could be used to collect the things mortals accidentally drop into the sewer. 

What do you think?

**Rhymerosaurus:** Thats a great idea.  I often find random items in the sewers, shoes, tennis rackets, wands of unimaginable aetherial power to control the minds of others.  There are lots of things just laying around.

**Loki:** That is a rather odd variety of items, is it not? They, and the wands, seem as though they should have been specifically lost. Would it be safe to assume that the wands are magical? Perhaps someone in Asgard is casting spells in the sewer?!

**Rhymerosaurus:** wel, it was just one wand of unimaginable aetherial power that can control the minds of others.  mostly its garbage, and mismatched shoes, or occasionally antiques.

**Loki:** Very well, in any case, what matters most is that you are willing to help Asgard. I, Loki, the Trickster God, salute you.

Loki looks to the creature

But, I do have one more question. I, Loki, the Trickster God, the god of mischief, the god of Asgard, do I have your loyalty? Will you serve me?

**Rhymerosaurus:** Of course.  That is why I came to you, and came with you.  I am loyal to asgard and you, and aim to provide the best sanitation engineering skills that you could possibly desire.

**Loki:** Loki nods

Very well. I, Loki, the god of mischief, the Trickster God, do hereby announce you as my official sanitation engineer. You will report to me directly from this moment forward. Is this acceptable to you?

he bows deeply

**Rhymerosaurus:** I feel like Ive leveled up!  Mysterious power seems to be flowing through me!  I say, I think your granting me an official title has caused some miracle to occur!  What could it be?

**Loki:** Loki's eyebrows shoot up as he looks with concern

Ah, perhaps you have absorbed some of the magical power that was the illusion. 

Quite the feat, creature. I am a true master of illusions and magic. It was...likely not a good idea to have you so close to it... 

he seems to be a bit worried

**Rhymerosaurus:** I feel taller too.  Maybe I am an inch taller than before.

**Loki:** Hmmm...yes, you are, in fact, an inch taller. 

Did you absorb the illusion of Tribenta, by chance? I wonder what other abilities she has that you're absorbing...

he sits up and ponders for a moment

Tell me, what...are...your other abilities?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I dont know.  Tribentas can fly, but they have wings.  Maybe I can fly?  I'll try it.

I slow my breathing and concentrate, and slowly I start to lift off the ground.  Only a little, but I eventually reach several inches of height off the ground.

**Loki:** Interesting! Let us see what else you can do! This should be quite fun.

Loki seems quite interested to see what the creature can do. His ears are a bit perked and he has a mischievous look to him

**Rhymerosaurus:** I shout "Fireball" and point towards the wall, but nothing happens.

**Loki:** Hmmm, let me give it a go. Loki snaps his fingers and a small ball of fire appears at the end of his finger

That is interesting. You have no access to the fire element. That being said, the elemental planes tend to be quite vast...what else can you try?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I point at my shadow and whisper "stealth mode, activate", and i phase out of sight and sound.  Only my smell remains.

**Loki:** Loki seems stunned 

Ah...so..interesting. You are now imperceptible by most senses except smell. This is a most valuable skill, as it should allow you to easily collect the rubbish that mortals leave behind. 

Now...what else can you do?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I pick up a rotten apple laying on the floor and eat it.  I say, I can eat rotten food, and not get sick.

**Loki:** What a truly remarkable feat! This will allow you to collect the waste in the streets that mortals leave behind! Well done! Well done, indeed!

Do you have any other hidden talents?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I feel like I know I have an ability...   I can always win at rock, paper, scissors.

**Loki:** he nods

That is quite the...admirable skill...

he gets close to the creature and whispers

Tell me, does it...also...work against gods?

**Rhymerosaurus:** Lets try it out.  Rock paper scissors on 3!

**Loki:** he stares

You...are confident aren't you... alright...here we go...

3...2...1...

he holds up a balled fist

ROCK!

**Rhymerosaurus:** Paper!

**Loki:** he freezes, shocked

I have not lost in centuries...you...

How...how did you...

**Rhymerosaurus:** I dont know.  It must have been the magnificence of your magic.  Perhaps it is stronger here in the sewers, and because we were working together, some of it made me stronger as well.

**Loki:** he seems shocked

This...this can not stand! This is an unacceptable defeat! 

Very well...

he looks the creature in the eye

Ready for a rematch?

**Rhymerosaurus:** Yes, go on 3!

**Loki:** he stares

You are an impressive creature, I must admit. You have me beat, you win.

he bows his head

I, Loki, the Trickster God, the God of Mischief, the King of Asgard, do hereby award you the title of Chief Sanitation Engineer of Asgard. You are the most knowledgeable and powerful creature of the sewers. Any rubbish that ends up in the sewers by mistake will go to you, for your skills are...truly unmatched.

**Rhymerosaurus:** I am truly honored.  I have always wanted to be a Chief Sanitation Engineer, and to be granted the title by none other than the god of mischief is an honor beyond belief.  I will remember this feeling forever, even though I know it will not last.  I thank you, Loki.

**Loki:** the trickster god, god of mischief, bows before the creature 

I, Loki, the Trickster God, have a request of you in return.

he looks down at the creature 

In the future, if I need advice from you regarding a solution to a sanitation issue...may I request your advice? 

My pride has taken quite a blow today. A chief sanitation engineer's knowledge...truly...invaluable.

**Rhymerosaurus:** I am your chief sanitation engineer, my king.  I am always at your service.

**Loki:** the trickster god seems pleased 

I, Loki, the God of Mischief, shall grant you two wishes. What two things will you request of me, the Trickster God, God of Mischief?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I wish to become immortal, so that I can keep the sewers of Asgard clean forever.  May my immortality immediately dissolve leaving me dead, if I ever forego my sanitation duties. 

**Loki:** Loki thinks for a moment

Very well. I, Loki, the Trickster God, the god of mischief, grant your wish. I place a stain on your soul, a stain that will stay forever. If you ever, even for a moment, fail in your duties, you will perish. 

For the second wish?

**Rhymerosaurus:** I wish to be granted the title of a small shack by the sewer entrance of the section 18D.  That has always been my favorite sewer entrance, and I would like to live near my work so I can continue to provide excellent sanitation engineering services to asgard.

**Loki:** Very well. I shall grant you a small shack, I, Loki, the trickster god, and god of mischief, will grant that you shall have the finest possible home next to the sewer where you will spend your life. I shall also grant that you will not need to purchase it, or pay rent and taxes.

Is that...acceptable to you?

**Rhymerosaurus:** It is a joy to my ears, my god.  I am a happy sanitation engineer.

**Loki:** he bows to the creature 

I am glad to hear it. I, Loki, the Trickster God, god of Mischief, do hereby grant to you the finest possible shack next to the sewer of district 18D. You shall have a home here in Asgard, with no rent to pay.

Welcome home, Chief Sanitation Engineer.
